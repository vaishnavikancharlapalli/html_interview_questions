All the contents which needs to be displayed on the web page like images, text, audio, video, contents, using elements like <p>, <img>, <audio>, <heading>, <video>, <div>, etc. will always be enclosed by the <body> tag.

14. What is the advantage of collapsing white space?

  fixed: This is similar to absolute except here the elements are positioned relative to the <html> element.
  relative: Here the element is positioned according to the normal flow of the document and positioned relative to its original/ normal position.
  initial: This resets the property to its default value.
  inherit: Here the element inherits or takes the property of its parent.

  flex: It displays the container and element as a flexible structure. It follows flexbox property.
  inline-flex: It displays the flex container as an inline element while it’s content follows the flexbox properties.
 grid: It displays the html elements as a grid container.
